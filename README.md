# Elevator
This project is designed to the student in Smart Technology academy in the first level of robotics track in order to figure out how to develop a simple elevator system using Arduino.

- The following circuit diagram shows the main concept behind this project, which we have a building contains ten floors.
- There is a digital sensor connected to the elevator's door at each floor.
- We simulated the digital sensor as a pushbutton.
- In addition to that the elevator consistis of a force sensor to detect any overloading condition.
